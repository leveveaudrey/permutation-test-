Memory (RAM): 4–8 GB Storage: 1–5 GB free disk space CPU: dual- or quad-core processor Processing time: typically under 1 hour per run for standard datasets.

In code, only the parameters between lines 6 and 18 to modify

on line 6 modify the name of your file in repository (name of example file in code)

on line 9 put a name for the analysis used for all output files (plots in svg format + summary table)

on line 11, put the name of the column with iddentity of group (Overused, underused and equallyused in example)

on line 13, put the name of the column of the tested value ( PHE score in example)

on line 15, put the name of the group used as control (equallyused in example)

on line 16, put the name of the group tested (Overused in example)

on line 15, put the size of the tested group (size of PEG+MEG in exampl)

on line 18, put the number of replicate for the simulated mean and median of two groups with  same size  (1000 in example)
